Description
============================

Solution to Cigna's "Uncover trends in healthcare spending" challenge on MindSumo, which can be seen [here](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/215). I got an honorable mention for my submission.

Using the Healthcare Spending Per Capita dataset, this program ranks the top 10 states with the highest total healthcare spending per capita (from years 2000 - 2009) and ranks all categories of healthcare services (e.g. hospital care, dental services, etc) from the highest total healthcare spending per capita to the lowest (in year 2009).

Usage
------
`java ParseHealthcareSpending.java [File name of CSV file]`

When no file argument is given, it looks for a file called "Healthcare_Spending_Per_Capita.csv". If a file is passed into the script, then it needs to be in the same format as the Healthcare_Spending_Per_Capita.csv file in this repository.
